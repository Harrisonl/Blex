A developer focused blogging platform written in Phoenix/Elixir.

### Features

Below is a list of the (proposed features) to be included in the Blex blog platform.

* **[Syntax Highlight](https://github.com/Harrisonl/Blex/issues/2)**: Choice between syntax highlighting or automatic creation of gists.
* **[Post Series](https://github.com/Harrisonl/Blex/issues/7)**: Group posts as being apart of a series (e.g. a tutorial) for easy display and navigation
* **[Project Links](https://github.com/Harrisonl/Blex/issues/6)**: Link posts to github repos and have a widget displayed clearly showing readers where they can find more info
* **[Meaningful Statistics](https://github.com/Harrisonl/Blex/issues/5)**: Show you where your most traffic is coming from and how users interact with your sites
* **[Inline Comments](https://github.com/Harrisonl/Blex/issues/4)**: Allow users to comment on particular lines in your post for more context specific comments.
* **[Import Blog Data](https://github.com/Harrisonl/Blex/issues/1)**: Import blog data automatically from other platforms such as Wordpress and Ghost
* **[Clarifying Links](https://github.com/Harrisonl/Blex/issues/8)**: Short blog posts which provide explanation on complex, but out of scope topics from another post.

If you have any other idea for features that you think would make blogging easier as a developer - feel free to craete an issue!

### Contributing
---
We are currently in need of contributors to help get Blex to it's first Alpha version.

We would love any and all help we can get.

Whilst working on improvements, please keep these ideas in mind:

* Blex is made for developer happiness first and foremost. This means a robust feature set and simple UX.
* Extensibility
* User Friendly
* Performant and Fault Tolerant (no 10mb javascript libraries!)


If you would like to contribute:

1. Click [Issues](https://github.com/harrisonl/blex/issues) and select a feature you want to tackle

2. Pull down the code and get the project setup or alternatively run the setup shell script to do it for you `./setup.sh`

3. Create a branch with a name resembling the issue you want to tackle

4. Make your changes/improvments, all the while ensuring you code is **clearly documented and tested**

5. Run `mix credo` to ensure that there are no violations.

6. Create a pull request :)

**We are also in need of someone to takeover the frontend design and implementation (considering how themes will be created)**
