We are currently in need of contributors to help get Blex to it's first Alpha version.

We would love any and all help we can get.

Whilst working on improvements, please keep these ideas in mind:

* Blex is made for developer happiness first and foremost. This means a robust feature set and simple UX.
* Extensibility
* User Friendly
* Performant and Fault Tolerant (no 10mb javascript libraries!)


If you would like to contribute:

1. Click [Issues](https://github.com/harrisonl/blex/issues) and select a feature you want to tackle

2. Pull down the code and get the project setup or alternatively run the setup shell script to do it for you `./setup.sh`

3. Create a branch with a name resembling the issue you want to tackle

4. Make your changes/improvments, all the while ensuring you code is **clearly documented and tested**

5. Run `mix credo` to ensure that there are no violations.

6. Create a pull request :)

**We are also in need of someone to takeover the frontend design and implementation (considering how themes will be created)**
